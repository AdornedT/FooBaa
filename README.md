# FooBaa

REQUEST: Write a program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

For every multiple of 3, print "Foo" instead of the number.
For every multiple of 5, print "Baa" instead of the number.
For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FooBaa" instead of the number.

Your solution should use the fewest lines of code possible but must produce efficient code.
